--------------------------------------Section 1: manage.py frequently used commands-------------------------------------
NOTE: Obviously the python manage.py commands have to be run from the location where manage.py is. That is the root
directory of the project itself. Adding the 'C:\\>' to the commands is just to signify that they are being run from the
command prompt.

[C:\\>python manage.py runserver]
^^^^^
Command used to startup the built-in python development server. By default it is
hosted on port:8000 (localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000)

[C:\\>python manage.py runserver 8080]
^^^^^
Adding the port parameter to the command will bring up the local server in the specified port number, port:8080 in this
example.

[C:\\>python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000]
^^^^^
This makes the local server public to all computers in the network. Handy to test on mobile devices or to showoff.
